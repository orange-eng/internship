Today, I just finished my last task in SCUT â€” the graduate respentation. As for me, it is less important about the result. It's so terrible! When I introduce my achievement in this term, three teachers seemed not so agreeable about what I say, becausee my research were mainly about CV, not Power Engineering. They pay more attention to my major without any interests in image inpainting. So I felt so ashamed and embarrassed when being blamed with.

Whatever,  I just try my best to explain my ideas. It's all over. And my grade in paper is 91. Amazing!

Today, we have a meeting with Pro Liu, who is the leader of our team. he is so strong, from MIT and Singapore. They just change the structure of each person so as to make inspiration for them to get higher. Instead of hierarchy, they have more oppoertunity to make improvement and get higher level in the future. What's more, maybe I have a chance to get recommendation from Pro Liu!
