Today, I just test COVID-19 in our shool hospital, which almost takes me 4 hours! And I have to come back to Tencent quickly. It is so busy but fruitful. Most Importantly, next Saturday is the NIKE running day! Just keep fighting!

It is always a good day! I finally get the precision-recall line in 23:00. As it is mentioned, the quality of data is so important for the result. For 50%-50% quantity, my method is superior to the former.

Today, I just finished my last task in SCUT — the graduate respentation. As for me, it is less important about the result. It's so terrible! When I introduce my achievement in this term, three teachers seemed not so agreeable about what I say, becausee my research were mainly about CV, not Power Engineering. They pay more attention to my major without any interests in image inpainting. So I felt so ashamed and embarrassed when being blamed with.

Whatever,  I just try my best to explain my ideas. It's all over. And my grade in paper is 91. Amazing!

Today, we have a meeting with Pro Liu, who is the leader of our team. he is so strong, from MIT and Singapore. They just change the structure of each person so as to make inspiration for them to get higher. Instead of hierarchy, they have more oppoertunity to make improvement and get higher level in the future. What's more, maybe I have a chance to get recommendation from Pro Liu!

There are some trouble about our team, and I just list some of them:

1. Value of each person is not so clear, which make it hard to find the donation of them.
2. It is so difficult to get higher under hierarchy
3. The project is so solid that there is not any contest in work.

So they make some progress.

1.destroy the hierarchy and establish the equal value.

2.make it clear about each one's work

3.finish the task without bound and make some fint-tuning in each task

Today, My score about graduation design is coming, and I get 89.67 in result. What a pity. What I want to do is just making my GPA higher than the original~ That is a pity in my whole Bachelor degree.

That's an interesting story~ I have loved the history of our country! There are lots of meaningful stories in it. And I can also get some useful ways to make friends with others.  

今天忽然想看吕蒙擒关羽，于是在B站上看到一个博主的解说，才发现有很多细节没有把控好。比如，杀了关羽，虽然使得吕蒙名震天下，但是又给东吴带来巨大灾难。有时候真的不能意气行事，要顾全大局。  
看着关羽也是来气，一生戎马，却因为过于傲慢，不听群臣劝阻，自以为是，最后葬送了自己。有时候真的要多听取忠言，不可以独断，铭记这个教训呀。  
今天也发现了一个好博主，解说真的超级到位，有空一定要吧他的视频都看完，积累经验，顺便补充一下红楼梦也不是坏事呀。

另外，今天我还完成了“地平线”公司的答辩操作。所说实话，这一周有点累，但是有的东西不懂就还是不懂，真的让人很头疼。但是面试官真的非常温顺，交流还是很开心的。不管结果如何，反正已经拿到百度研究院offer，很开心呀。

I have some feelings about Bang Liu and Yu Xiang in history. That's also interesting and profounded for me.

刘邦和项羽的故事一直都千古流传。一开始是项羽的气焰更胜，刘邦只是一个无名小卒，但是刘邦没有傲气，广识各路英雄豪杰，普通百姓出身，却也能灭亡秦国。这主要是因为他深得民心，体恤百姓，而且擅长交友，实在佩服。而项羽是西楚霸王，确因为格局太小，只想做楚国的君王，衣锦还乡而已。相比于刘邦，项羽显得有些幼稚，实在是悲哀至极。  
说实话，当刘邦看到昔日仇人，匆忙下跪，只为了苟全性命，不计较眼前利益。这真的很像韩信，忍辱负重，一定是心中有远大理想，才不会在意眼前的得失。我希望我研究生时期也可以培养出这种精神。

修改专利。编辑人对现有技术的排列组合并不看好，由于这些方法都是基于现有技术的基础之上，所以并不能获得认同，重点在于特征向量的制作过程，成了专利的核心内容。让我思考一下，如果想要制作特征向量，感觉不能是一维的，这样显得有些简单了。
